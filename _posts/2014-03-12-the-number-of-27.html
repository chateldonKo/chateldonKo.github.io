<h1> {{page.title}}</h1>
<p>If given you 27 dollors,you may be thinking that 27 is too small.If given you a task that 27 bugs must be found,you may feel there are so many jobs you have to do.In the same way, 27 is much smaller than 100,much bigger than 5 or 6 or else.<br/>Relatively or absolutely.</p>
<p>Time witnesses my 27 years.Many people around me in 27s talked like this "I am old,not young anymore".Even some in 20s do the same.I am confused.For me,27s is not young.But it also cant be called old. </p>
<p>I have lots of things in my to_do list.And there are many things i wanna to learn and try.27 is a perfect time for me to do everything what i want. I can survive by my work,honestly kind of good.Luckily ,dont have to work after 7 every night.So I can do something i want,basketing,dancing or whatever.<br/>Also I like to learn something fresh.But I have to dig them deep,more details.Not just know a little.</p>
<p>Looking back my 27 year,I express my gratitude to my parents and my lively family.It is my parents who make can live a great life without thinking life is hard and awful.I can live the life i want.Thanks to my boyfriend who love me so much and make me love myself more than before.I love him so much.I appreciate god bring him to me.</p>
<p>What I want to be afte 27.I want to develop my IOS app.I want to take part in the IELTS examination.I want to go to the New Zealand with my bf.I want to take my parent to some nice place.I want to get married and persist in keeping fit.I want to read more and learn more.There are so many beautiful stuffs I want to exprience. </p>
<p>Hard work & Be a nice guy. </p>
<p>27 is a start ,is brand_new to me.I like it and I appreciate it.</p>
