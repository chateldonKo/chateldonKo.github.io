<p>范文:</p>
<p>"Do as I say,not as I do."This is what society tells us when it punishes murders with the death penalty.Society tells us that murder is wrong,and in our legal system,murder is against the law.Yet we still see our society kill murders,and thus we are committing murder ourselves.For this reason,the death penalty should end,and instead murders should be punished with life in prison.</p>
<p>Society needs to show a positive model of how our lives should be and how people should act.We should always strive to improve our situation,to be at peace and in harmony with others.However,when we kill murderers,we are not working to improve our society.Instead,we are stooping to the criminals' level.</p>
<p>It makes me think about the revenge that came when playing game with my brothers.When we were kids/children,my brother would take my toys,so I would hit him and take my toys back.Then he would hit me harder and take my toys back.Then he would hit me harder and take the toys again.Thinking of the death penalty,I imagine a murderer kills someone.Society takes revenge by killing the murderer.This leaves behind the murderer's family and friends.who have tremendous anger inside of them,which they may release onto society.The cycle of killing goes on and on.</p>
<p>Society should not condemn people who are taking the same action that cociety is taking.Society tells us not to kill,and yet society kills when it exercises the death penalty.Because of this contradiction,we should end the death penalty and instead punish murderers by sentencing them to life to prison.</p>
